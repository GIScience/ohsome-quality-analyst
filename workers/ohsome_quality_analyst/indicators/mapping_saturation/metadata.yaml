  name: Mapping Saturation
  description: |
    Calculate if mapping has saturated.
  label_description:
    red: |
      Saturation has not been reached at all.
      The mapping in this region are in just starting.
      With regard to completeness this means bad quality.

    yellow: |
      Saturation not yet reached. The data in this region still seem to be in
      a growth stadium with a growth of data more than 3 % within the last 3 years.
      This indicates a difficult to specify quality in respect to completeness,
      because it depends on the growth rate over time. The growth could be
       near to saturated or still be in an high growth stadium.

    green: |
      Saturation has been reached. The data in this region seem quite saturated
      with a growth of data less than 3 % within the last 3 years.
      This indicates good quality in respect to completeness.

    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator.
      This is most likely due to the fact that no features have been mapped
      for this area of interest. Refer to other indicators that rely on
      an extrinsic comparison to identify if this means that data quality is
      bad or if there is just nothing to map here.

  result_description: |
    Saturation is reached if growth is minimal,
    the value to describe completed saturation is ~1.0.
    The saturation level for the last 3 years is $saturation
    with a growth rate of $growth."
